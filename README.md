## Deployment Guide for Firebase Studio

Congratulations on building your app! Hereâ€™s how to deploy it and connect your custom domain from GoDaddy using the Firebase Studio interface.

### Step 1: Deploy Your App with a Single Click

Firebase Studio makes deploying your application incredibly simple.

1.  **Find the "Publish" Button:** Look for the **Publish** button, typically located in the top-right corner of the Firebase Studio editor.
2.  **Click to Deploy:** Clicking **Publish** will automatically build your Next.js application and deploy it to Firebase App Hosting. This single step handles the entire process for you.
3.  **Wait for Deployment:** The process will take a few minutes. Once it's complete, you will be given a unique URL for your live site (e.g., `https://your-project-name--live-xxxxxxxx.web.app`). Visit this URL to see your deployed app!

### Step 2: Connect Your GoDaddy Domain

Now, let's connect your custom domain (e.g., `www.your-domain.com`).

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console:**
    *   Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Select your project.
    *   In the left-hand menu, go to **Build > App Hosting**.

2.  **Add Custom Domain:**
    *   Click the **"Add custom domain"** button.
    *   Enter the domain you own on GoDaddy (e.g., `www.your-domain.com`) and click "Continue".

3.  **Verify Ownership (TXT Record):**
    *   Firebase will provide you with a **TXT record** to verify that you own the domain. It will look something like `google-site-verification=...`.
    *   **Keep the Firebase page open** and open a new browser tab.
    *   Log in to your **GoDaddy** account.
    *   Navigate to your domain's **DNS Management** page.
    *   Add a new DNS record with the following details:
        *   **Type:** `TXT`
        *   **Name/Host:** `@` (or your domain name, depending on GoDaddy's interface)
        *   **Value:** Paste the verification code from Firebase.
        *   **TTL:** Leave as default (usually 1 hour).
    *   Save the record in GoDaddy.

4.  **Point Your Domain to Firebase (A Records):**
    *   Switch back to the Firebase Console tab and click **"Verify"**. This can take a few minutes to a few hours.
    *   Once verified, Firebase will show you two **IP addresses (A records)**.
    *   Go back to your **GoDaddy DNS Management** page.
    *   Add **two** new `A` records:
        *   **Record 1:**
            *   **Type:** `A`
            *   **Name/Host:** `@`
            *   **Value/Points to:** The first IP address from Firebase.
            *   **TTL:** Leave as default.
        *   **Record 2:**
            *   **Type:** `A`
            *   **Name/Host:** `@`
            *   **Value/Points to:** The second IP address from Firebase.
            *   **TTL:** Leave as default.
    *   Save these records in GoDaddy.

5.  **Finalize in Firebase:**
    *   Go back to the Firebase Console and click **"Finish"**.
    *   Firebase will now provision an SSL certificate for your domain. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours.

Once complete, your site will be live and secure at your custom GoDaddy domain!

### Troubleshooting: DNS is Locked or Not Editable on GoDaddy

If you find that you cannot add or edit TXT and A records in your GoDaddy DNS panel, it's almost always because your domain is not using GoDaddy's default nameservers. This can happen if you previously used a different website builder or hosting service.

**Firebase requires you to add A records, not change nameservers.** To fix this, you must switch back to GoDaddy's default nameservers.

1.  **Log in to GoDaddy** and go to your **Domain Portfolio**.
2.  Select your domain to go to the **Domain Settings** page.
3.  Find and click on **"Manage DNS"**.
4.  Scroll down to the **Nameservers** section.
5.  Click the **"Change"** button.
6.  You will likely see custom nameservers listed. Select the option that says **"I want to use GoDaddy default nameservers"** (or similar wording).
7.  **Save** the changes.

**Important:**
*   **Disruption Warning:** Changing nameservers will disconnect any active website or email service currently linked to those custom nameservers. Proceed only if you are ready to point the domain to your new Firebase app.
*   **Propagation Time:** It can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours for the nameserver change to take effect across the internet. Once it does, the DNS management section in GoDaddy will become fully editable, and you can proceed with adding the Firebase A and TXT records as described in Step 2 above.
